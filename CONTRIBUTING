# How to contribute

Hi, we're glad you want to help this project grow. If you need help with anything,
feel free to open an issue or discussion topic.

## Set up your dev environment

You'll need the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Some IDE with TypeScript support (e.g. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jls-digital/cem-plugin-complex-types.git`
2. Run `pnpm install`
3. In a stÂ§orybook project, add `"cem-plugin-complex-types": "link:<path_to_cloned_repo>",` to the `dependencies` in `package.json`
4. Run `pnpm install` in the storybook project
5. Enable the addon in `custom-elements-manifest.config.mjs` (see example below)

```ts
// custom-elements-manifest.config.mjs
export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    cemPluginComplexTypes(['./src/**/*.ts']),
  ],
};
```

## Submitting a pull request

Create a new branch or a fork from the main branch and make your changes. Then
open a pull request with a description of your changes and thoughts behind them.

## Coding conventions

Coding conventions should be enforced by eslint and prettier. You can run the
linter with `pnpm check:lint` and the formatter with `pnpm check:format`. Autofixable errors
can be fixed across all files with `pnpm check:lint:fix` or `pnpm check:format:fix` respectively.

## Ideas for future features

- Support all languages from prism/hljs. Storybook's syntax highlighter only uses
a limited set of languages.
- Automatic import of source code files
- Ctrl + click to jump to reference (e.g. in Interface)
- Button to open code (local file) in editor
